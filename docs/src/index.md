# ComputationGraphs.jl

*Making computation more efficient.*

A package for improving the speed (and energy consumption) of numerical computations
that need to be performed repeatedly.

## Package key features

+ Allocation-free operation
+ Re-use of previously performed computations
+ Symbolic differentiation
+ Algebraic simplifications

The [User manual](@ref Basics) provides a tutorial explaining how to get started using `ComputationGraphs`.

Illustrative examples can be found on the [Examples](@ref) page.

See the [API](@ref) for the complete list of documented functions and types.
